Things to do:
=============
 * Memory allocation safety
   -> Incoming packets should not be able to steal buffers for acknowledgements in TCP
 * Routing
 * TCP: Timewait state: Do we need to wait for closing/aborting a connection after fin
   packet? (Half open requests support should handle this, although not rfc conform)
 * TCP: Document all tcp internal methods and consolidate if possible
 * TCP: receive/listen: may be specific to IPv4/IPv6 or the IP class interface has to
        provide a is_src_dest_addr_matching(Packet*) method or a tcp connection stores
        ip src/dest addr bytes and addrs length and compares to bytes of ip_packet
 * TCP: Get rid of freeReceivedSegment (State machine should use ReceiveBuffer instead
        of segment+len)
