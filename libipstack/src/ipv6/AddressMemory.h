/**
 * A memory block for storing ipv6 address entries (with additional data). This memory
 * is used for three types of entries currently: AddressEntry, NDPCacheEntry, MulticastEntry.
 * Although it is a good idea to store all types in one shared memory instead of having
 * a separate storage for each type (imbalanced usage pattern!), the current implementation
 * is not optimized for efficiency. The memory is divided into segments by the size of the
 * biggest structure that will be stored. If AdressMemory is searched by one type (for example
 * "AddressEntry"-type), every segment in the entire memory have to be looked at.
 *
 * Possible improvement:
 * * Fill memory from two sides. The storage-side depends on the entry type.
 * * Insertion sort: A sorted list of entries (sorting AddressEntry by IPv6, sorting NDPCacheEntry
 *                   by ethernet address) allows to use binary search
