	 * This TCP Server implementation consists of two things:
	 * 
	 * Overriden accept() method
	 * -------------------------
	 * If a new incoming connection has been accepted, instead of changing the
	 * tcp server sockets state to established we continue to stay in the listen state
	 * and return one of the tcp sockets out of the pool of sockets.
	 * 
	 * A pool of TCP Sockets
	 * ---------------------
	 * This is useful for a webserver for example, even if you have memory for just 1 socket available,
	 * because after one request from the browser a socket is usually closed. Due to the
	 * necessary delay in the waitstate for two times the maximum segment lifetime (MSL)
	 * a socket's memory cannot be freed/reused. Although the socket in most cases does not need any
	 * memory anymore, because it usually just waits for a timeout, it nevertheless blocks
	 * the memory. If you use a tcp socket pool instead, one SocketMemory
	 * is shared among all tcp sockets returned by the pool.

			 * This will put a socket of the pool into listen state and block until a connection

			 * to start listing (with another socket of the pool) again.
			 * @return Return a tcp socket in the established state from the pool of sockets or 0
			 * if either the pool is already used completly or a problem occured.

			 * Usage example:
			 * TCP_Socket* clientSocket;

			 *  // use the client socket
			 * 	clientSocket->write("test",4);
			 *  // free socket and make it usable by the pool again
