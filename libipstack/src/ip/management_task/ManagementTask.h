	 * The Management_Task is a singleton and required to get access to all
	 * management sockets.
	 * 
	 * If you have a multitask system, create a task and call run(). You should
	 * implement block() for performance reasons that should block the task while
	 * no new packet is received. If you are using a single task system, you do not
	 * have to interact with this class because runIteration is called from
	 * IP::periodic().
	 * 
	 * For adding a management socket you would do this:
	 * 1) Slice in a <MEMORY& get_mem_your_socket()> function where yoo
	 *    create your socket memory as static variable and return it.
	 * 2) Slice in a <YOUR_SOCKET& get_your_socket()> function where yoo
	 *    create your socket as static variable  and call get_mem_your_socket() to get the sockets memory.
	 * 
	 *    Example:
	 *    static MemoryInterface& get_mem_icmpv4() { static ManagementSocketMemory mem; return mem; }
	 *    ICMPv4_Socket& get_socket_icmpv4() { static ICMPv4_Socket socket(get_mem_icmpv4()); return socket; }
