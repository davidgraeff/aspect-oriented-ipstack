	/**
	 * A sendbuffer is used for all sending activity within the tcp/ip stack. It is manipulated and filled
	 * by different aspects of the network stack layers. The size for the buffer has to be known beforehand
	 * to allocate the memory.
	 * You have to request a send-buffer to send data via send(...) in sockets.
	 * 
	 * Write your payload either to the data address like in this example:
	 * Socket s;
	 * SendBuffer* b = s.requestSendBuffer(size);
	 * if (!b) ABORT();
	 * memcpy(b->getDataPointer(), "test", 4);
	 *
	 * You may omit memcpy for integers for example with this code:
	 * ((uint32_t*)b->getDataPointer()) = 47248459;
	 * b->writtenToDataPointer(size_of(uint32_t)); // tell the sendbuffer how many bytes you have written
	 * s.send(b);
	 * 
	 * Another way of writting to a sendbuffer is using the write method:
	 * write(const char* data, uint16_t length);
	 * 
	 * Always check if you got a null pointer as a result. This indicates your
	 * requested size is to big or there is no memory chunk of this size
	 * available at the moment. Wait and try it later.
	 * 
	 * A SendBuffer object is invalid after calling send with it. You have to
	 * request a new one for more data to send. YOu may also use recycle() under
	 * some conditions.
	 * 
	 * Always free a SendBuffer after sending it (if you do not want to recycle it).
	 * Call socket.free(sendBuffer);
	 *
