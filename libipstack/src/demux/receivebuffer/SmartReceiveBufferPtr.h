	* Smart pointer for ReceiveBuffer. Will free the ReceiveBuffer, if pointer class goes out of scope.
	* If you want the object to survive the scope, either copy this smart pointer (c++ copy operator, c++11 move operator)
	* or extract the ReceiveBuffer pointer with "takeOwnership".
	* 
	* Please notice: There is no copy semantic for this smart pointer. If you do a copy or assignment
	* internally always a move is executed and the original smart pointer is invalid after that. Example:
	* 
	* SmartReceiveBufferPtr sb = socket->receive();
	* if (sb==0) {abort();}
	* SmartReceiveBufferPtr other_sb(sb);
	* // sb is 0 now!
	* SmartReceiveBufferPtr other_sb2 = other_sb;
	* // other_sb is 0 now!
