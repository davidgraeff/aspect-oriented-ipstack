/**
 * Purpose:
 * Instead of copying the input data to a socket buffer and process it there in the user context, a direct response
 * with the remote addresses given in the input data is executed. This procedure saves cpu cycles for not copying,
 * saves memory on the embedded system and shortens the latency.
 * It should only be used by ICMP or other management tasks which are not directly related to application tasks, because
 * no reschedule is allowed while generating the response.
 * Used by:
 * - All ICMP functionality that respond directly to a packet, - TCP_Reset
 * Internal:
 * Store a pointer to the beginning of an input stream (network layer data should be located there)
 * and a boolean "directResponse". Fills in the link layer address of the source as destination address,
 * before ARP/NDP do a lookup.
