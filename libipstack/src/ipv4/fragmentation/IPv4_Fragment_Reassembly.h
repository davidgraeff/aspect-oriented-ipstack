/**
 * TODO:
 * * link IPv4_Fragment_Reassembly together. We need one IPv4_Fragment_Reassembly
 *   object for every unique Identification.
 * * Determine right IPv4_Fragment_Reassembly object for each received fragmented packet.
 * * Timeout handling
 * * Freeing ReceiveBuffer for timeouts or handover reassambled packets is only possible if
 *   socket is known! (SocketMemory class!) -> fortunately we know the SocketMemory object because
 *   we intercept addToReceiveQueue.
 * * Allocation of a smaller buffer is necessary for each IPv4_Fragment_Reassembly for the
 *   bitmap part
 * * If no fragmentation support -> we may want to send an icmp message (dest_not_reachable:size)
