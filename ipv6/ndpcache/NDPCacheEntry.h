 * An IPv6->Link layer address cache. Because NDP is link layer agnostic your
 * link layer have to weave in some members. 
 *
 * The link layer address and address size have to be weaved in by an aspect.
 * If you develop a link layer you have to weave in the following two members:
 * - enum {LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS_SIZE = 6; } // for a 6 byte link layer address
 * - UInt8 hw[LINK_LAYER_ADDRESS_SIZE];
 * 
 * Synchronous: Without further influence by an aspect this implementation is synchronous:
 * The process flow is blocked while looking up a link layer address.
 *
 * Expire: Without further influences by aspects an ndp cache entry may never expire.
